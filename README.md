Redi Final Project:  This is a computer quiz game,where by the developer asks a bunch of question and people give an asnwera for each question.If the answer is correct a score of 1 point rewarded and nothing for a wrong answer! The program give the total number of points score as well as the percentage achieved at the end.Its a real fun you can always change questions and the given answers to suit your own personal situation, especially for kids because I've been playing it with my kids the last time around! It can also be used in real time situations like in schools for learning purposes.


Room for development:  It can be developed and advanced forinstance, instead of always writing the answers manually make it automated maybe by the use of AI to make it quicker and easier for everyone.


Disadvantages: You have to be able to read and write in order to play the game which makes it a no-option for small kids who yet to read and write.


Motivation:  Since we are living in a digitally advancing world on daily basis, it was actually a question of time when I was to get into the Tech world, thank goodness, ReDi school was kind of an inspiration for me to get started. Hohestly I wasn't so sure at the beginning, because it sounded too good to be true but I enjoyed each and every moment so far and it has given me such a push and confidence that I can now say: "The sky is the limit!!!" A big thank to everyone involved especially the teaching staff who have been extremely nice and friendly to us students!!! Really proud of being part of this project and looking forward for a brighter future together!!
